A simple rich text format widget for adding formatted HTML to sidebars. 

== Description ==
I needed a very simple way to add formatted text to the sidebar on my blog. I used this simple plugin along with an old rich text javascript file that I wrote and wound up with this. It works on my blogs, but the javascript may not work if oyu are using anything but the default admin pages in WordPress.
I have been testing with FireFox 10 and IE8. I hope that other browsers work. In any case, the widget display should be well formed and standard HTML and display pretty much the same in all browsers.

Please report all bugs immediately.
